# US County Map (KML)

This repo includes KML files for all counties within the United States:
- Formatted Counties: KML files for all counties (modified from original to remove styling and \<Point\> placemarks).
- Grouped Counties: KML files containing all counties grouped by state/territory (styling and \<Point\> placemarks have also been removed).

I created [this Google My Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1KsfdbZ9LaHd3gNX2s0X9GSZOUB_U9wg&usp=sharing) for demonstration purposes.

Information sourced from https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/us-county-overlays-kml and partially from Boundmaps.
